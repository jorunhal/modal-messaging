# Modal Messaging
Two classes are written in JavaScript, one which represents a modal window, and another which stores ID-ed messages which are then viewed using an instance of said modal window class as a message box. The accompanying HTML file is merely to illustrate how it can, as an example, be used to fetch texts from a form and then viewed in the message box.

The project as it stands can be described as bare-bones, in that little attention is paid to styling in terms of colours, fonts etc. The main emphasis is on the functionality.

See script modalwindow.js for explanation.
